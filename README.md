# Description
A python script that can be used to check if a web store has available stock for a certain product.
It simply retrieves the page content every couple minutes and looks for a specific text string that indicates NO stock. If the string is NOT found, a notification is pushed to a device using pushbullet.

# Usage
Simply run `run_script.bat` to execute the script.
